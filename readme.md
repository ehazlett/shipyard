# Shipyard [![Build Status](http://ci.evanhazlett.com/api/badge/github.com/shipyard/shipyard/status.svg?branch=master)](http://ci.evanhazlett.com/github.com/shipyard/shipyard)

Composable Docker Management


Shipyard enables multi-host, Docker cluster management.  It uses the [Citadel](https://github.com/citadel/citadel) toolkit for cluster resourcing and scheduling.  Shipyard has been dramatically simiplified and only requires access to the Docker Remote API and a RethinkDB instance.

# Quick Start

## Shipyard Deploy
Shipyard Deploy will automatically start a Shipyard stack on a desired Docker Engine.

```
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock shipyard/deploy start
```
## Using fig ([fig.yml from project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llitfkitfk/shipyard/master/fig.yml)) 

* Create containers
```
fig up -d
```
* Start the Shipyard project:
```
fig start
```

## Manual
* Start a data volume instance of RethinkDB:
```
docker run -it -d --name shipyard-rethinkdb-data \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash shipyard/rethinkdb -l
```

* Start RethinkDB with using the data volume container:
```
docker run -it -P -d --name shipyard-rethinkdb \
  --volumes-from shipyard-rethinkdb-data shipyard/rethinkdb
```

* Start the Shipyard controller:
```
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -d --name shipyard \
  --link shipyard-rethinkdb:rethinkdb shipyard/shipyard
```

You can then use the Shipyard CLI to interact:

* `docker run --rm -it shipyard/shipyard-cli`

This will drop you into a shell with the Shipyard executable.  Use `shipyard login` to login to the Shipyard instance.  Use `shipyard add-engine` to add an engine and get started.  See the [docs](http://shipyard-project.com/docs/quickstart/) for more information.

Use `shipyard help` to see full options.

# Components
There are four components to Shipyard:

## Controller
The Shipyard controller talks to a RethinkDB instance for data storage (user accounts, engine addresses, events, etc).  It also serves the API and web interface (see below).  The controller uses Citadel to communicate to each host and handle cluster events.

## API
Everything in Shipyard is built around the Shipyard API.  It enables actions such as starting, stopping and inspecting containers, adding and removing engines and more.  It is a very simple RESTful JSON based API.

## CLI
The Shipyard CLI is a Docker inspired command line interface to a Shipyard cluster.  It has been built from the ground up to support every feature that Shipyard offers.

## UI
The Shipyard UI is a web interface to the Shipyard cluster.  It uses the Shipyard API for all interaction.  It is an AngularJS app that is served via the Controller.

# Contributing

## Controller
To get a development environment you will need:

* Go 1.3+
* Node.js: (npm for bower to build the Angular frontend)

Run the following:

* install [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep): `go get github.com/tools/godep`
* cd into the `controller` directory and run  `make deps` to get the Go dependencies
* run `npm install -g bower` to install bower
* `cd` into the `static` directory and run `bower install`
* run `make build` to build the binary
* run `./controller -h` for options

## CLI
For CLI hacking you will need:

* Go 1.3+

Run the following:

* install [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep): `go get github.com/tools/godep`
* run `make deps` to get the Go dependencies
* run `make build` to build the binary
* run `./cli -h` for options
