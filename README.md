# Shipyard Project
After a long time I have decided to retire this project.  It formed the foundation for
what became Docker Universal Control Plane and I no longer have time to manage this.
I asked for new maintainers but there
seemed to be no interest.

**WARNING**: as the project retired I no longer maintained the domain.  Someone else has setup a duplicate site that is not official and is carrying an invalid SSL certificate.  PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THE DOMAIN shipyard-project.com.  I cannot endorse it nor vouch for the security or content of the site.

I want to thank all of the [contributors](https://github.com/shipyard/shipyard/graphs/contributors)
for all of your help.  Thank you.

I will keep this repository open for a while to keep the source accessible for anyone that
wants it.

If you are looking for alternatives, here are a few open source Docker management
applications available:

- [Rancher](http://rancher.com/)
- [Docker UI](https://github.com/kevana/ui-for-docker)
- [Portainer](https://portainer.io/)

Thank you. Eric
